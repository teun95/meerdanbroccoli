This dish is the first dish I saved when I started my recipe folder and actively searched for more vegetarian dishes. It's amazingly simple: precook gnocchi, cut vegetables, and put it in the oven. In the original Tesco recipe, you have to make the pesto yourself as a garnish. But I don't have time for that during the week, so I always serve this dish with self-bought pesto instead of self-made. If you want to make it a bit more luxurious, you can always buy fresh pesto instead of the long life pesto. Oh and use green pesto, not red.
