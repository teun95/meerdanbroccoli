A quick weekday meal that is sure to surprise you. I love making this dish because it’s easy, delicious and quick. Perfect for busy weekdays yet equally satisfying during the weekend. This is a delicious dish which uses tofu in a new way by coating it in a mixture of sweet chili sauce before rolling it in coconut. Fry it up and you get a juicy piece of tofu with a crispy sweet coating. If you don’t like tofu yet, you will after this dish.

Originally, this recipe uses wok-ready noodles but I prefer to make this dish with whatever noodles I still have at home. They cook in 3-5 minutes anyway so I will just let them cook while preparing everything else. You don’t lose any time with this approach! I also doubled the coating of the recipe to make the tofu extra crisp and sweet.

10 minutes preparation + 10 minutes cooking — serves 2

Enjoy your meal!
