A family favourite, this is how I learned to prepare risotto. I've been making this dish for about three to four years. And I have adapted the recipe many times. More spinach. Less risotto. Adding some peas. First served with fish, instead of the original recipeâ€™s suggestion of steak, and now fully vegetarian. This is the perfect dish to show how you can adapt your favourite dish and make it vegetarian.
