This is a delicious summer pasta. The combination of spaghetti with a lemon dressing, supplemented with fresh tomatoes and avocado makes this a great dish for warmer days.

The dish is originally from a [Tesco magazine](https://realfood.tesco.com/recipes/creamy-avocado-pasta.html) and I didn't have to adjust much. I only made some minor adjustments to the ratios of vegetables and spaghetti.

The great thing about this dish is that it is ready so quickly. All you really have to do is cook the spaghetti and make the dressing, and that's it. The heat of the cooked spaghetti will wilt the spinach before you serve it with a delicious combination of green vegetables and avocado!
