There's something about a bowl of lentil soup that feels like a hug in a bowl. It's warm, comforting, and hearty—perfect for a chilly day. This vegan lentil soup recipe not only ticks all those boxes, but it's also incredibly easy to make, requiring just a few basic ingredients that you probably already have in your pantry. Plus, it's packed full of nourishing ingredients that are both good for you and good for the planet.

Red lentils are the star of this soup. They're an excellent source of protein, fiber, and iron, and they have a lovely, naturally creamy texture when cooked. I love using them in soup because they're quick to cook and don't require any pre-soaking. Plus, their mild flavor means they take on the flavors of the other ingredients well.

To give the soup some added depth and complexity, I've utilized cumin and turmeric. Cumin adds a warm, earthy flavor that's absolutely perfect in a hearty soup like this, while turmeric provides a subtle, tangy undertone and a beautiful golden color.

Served up with some crusty bread, this vegan lentil soup is a meal in itself. But if you want to make it even heartier, feel free to add some cooked rice or quinoa, or even some leafy greens like spinach or kale would work well. 

It's flexible too! You can adjust the consistency of the soup depending on how you like it. If you prefer a chunkier soup, blend less or not at all. If you prefer a smoother, creamier soup, blend more.
