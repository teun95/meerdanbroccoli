Gado Gado is an Indonesian salad. This dish is a simple, easy way to get your daily amount of veggies and is not just complete without the delicious peanut sauce that is served with it. The touch of sweet, spice and tangy taste of the sauce just enhance the overall flavor of this dish. I usually prepare this dish with vegetables that cook quickly and use some frozen vegetables to make this into a quick and healthy meal. This dish sure is nostalgic because it reminds me of the hours we spent snorkeling in Bali, followed by a late lunch at a small local restaurant. Gado Gado. Rice. And that delicious peanut sauce. 

To make into a filling meal rather than a side dish, we added some brown basmati rice. We also experimented with the protein and learned how to fry delicious tofu to go with this meal instead of eggs. Both versions are described in the recipe. If you do want to serve it with crackers, we'd suggest going with cassava-based ones.
