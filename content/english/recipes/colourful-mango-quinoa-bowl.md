A perfect dish to share with friends and family. Put it all on the table and let everyone serve themselves. I love this dish for several reasons. First of all, it just looks great because of the different colours of vegetables. And then there's delicious mango - nothing beats a juicy, ripe mango. It brings me right back to our trip to India and Indonesia. 

And then there's the tofu. Before this dish, I really was not a fan of tofu at all. But this is the dish that changed my mind. We fry the tofu and then add some sweet chili sauce. Delicious! 

It is difficult to serve this dish and get everything on one plate. I'd suggest putting the mango and vegetables on a large serving plate and let everyone serve themselves. This is also an easy recipe to double up if you have more guests.
