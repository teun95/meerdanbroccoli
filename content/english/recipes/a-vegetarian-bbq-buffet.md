You really do not have to give up everyone’s favourite summer pass-time when you eat more vegetarian. The best part about any summer BBQ is the options to fill your plate with lots of different things. The barbecued “meat” is really only one part of it. So with this dish we’re making two different salads and a delicious vegetarian burger that is as close as it gets to your familiar meat burger.

You can rock up to your next BBQ with your vegetarian burger and those two amazing salads, and I promise you will have a great time. Or make this dish at home without a BBQ and cook your burger in a pan — just as tasty.

This dish features my not-so-secret potato salad. Potato is really the hero of it, and unlike store-bought potato salads, we only use the minimum amount of mayonaise required to make it a nice smooth salad. The “secret” to this dish is to not only fill the salad with potatoes, but to add apple to it too. It turns this salad into a fresh salad that keeps you coming back for more. There is the anticipation with each bite: will it be potato? Or apple? Or both?

And then of course there is the fresh tomato and edamame salad. It’s a light salad you whip up very quickly and adds a nice counterbalance to the heavier potato salad. Enjoy your meal!
