It is no secret that I love Indian food. But the fact that I am not made for spicy food does complicate things. This dish is a perfect answer.

There are two heroes in this dish: paneer and the amazing mix of vegetables. Paneer is a hard Indian cheese we will fry in the pan. The vegetables are a mix of mangeout, green beans and petit peas.

The original recipe for 'matar paneer' is from the cookbook Fresh India by one of my favourite chefs, Meera Sodha, and as usual I’ve only made small adaptations. Mainly to make the recipe easier. I’ve broken up the instructions into more manageable steps, and used frozen and canned vegetables. Equally tasty but less work.
