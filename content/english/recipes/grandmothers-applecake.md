    ingredients:
    instructions:
      - 'Separate the egg yolks from the whites. Keep them separated.'
      - 'Melt the butter in a sauce pan. Take care not to brown the butter - it only needs to melt. Use a microwave if you find that easier.'
      - 'Mix the vanilla sugar and regular sugar with the melted butter.'
      - 'Stir the egg yolks, milk and salt through the butter mix.'
      - 'Mix the baking soda with the flour. Slowly fold the flour through the butter mix to create the cake batter.'

    ingredients:
    instructions:

    ingredients:
    instructions:
      - 'Place the baking tin in the preheated oven for at least one hour.'
      - 'Leave the cake to rest in the baking tin for at least 10 minutes before you take it out of the baking tin (pull it from the sides of the baking paper to take it out of the tin when ready). I’d suggest you leave the cake resting for another 20 minutes before indulging, to ensure the cake becomes firm enough and the apple pieces don’t fall out.'

My first memories of cooking aren't about cooking at all. My memories are focused on the food that I enjoyed. More accurately, they’re all about my grandmother’s food.

I don’t exactly remember when I started to pay attention to how my grandmother managed to get that delicious food on the table, but I do remember following her around her tiny kitchen from a young age. First it was just to spend time with her and to help her, but that soon turned into asking questions and learning from her.

She inspired me to cook and to bake, and to collect recipes. My own recipe collection is filled with recipes and handwritten notes that I took from her kitchen. Mostly these are about dishes she used to make for my mum and I.

One of the loose notes I took was a small page which had a list of ingredients on them, followed by short instructions on what to do with them.

The recipe below is my interpretation of my grandmother’s notes as they form the basis of what is now my favourite apple cake. I assure you that this recipe has been tested with love many times already, and I hope you enjoy the cake as much as I do!
