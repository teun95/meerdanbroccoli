This salad is deliciously refreshing and filling. Perfect for warmer days. Salads don't have to be boring at all. And even though I'm still experimenting with the best combinations, this delicious couscous salad is already at the top of my list.

The [original recipe](https://www.jumbo.com/recepten/vegetarische-couscoussalade-met-kikkererwten,-feta-en-rozijnen-504567) comes from a Dutch magazine, but I adapted it by using goat cheese instead of feta, and by using more products from the pantry. I have prepared this salad in different ways, with different types of goat cheese, but it is best if you use hard goat cheese. Soft is also possible, but because goat cheese has a strong taste, a hard goat cheese is easier to mix in without overpowering the other flavours.

And finally, a quick note about the olive oil. Make sure you use a good quality one. I currently have a fairly exclusive version, pressed on my mum's colleague's farm, but as long as you use an extra virgin olive oil you'll be fine.
