**The more time you spend on the baked potatoes, the better this dish gets.**



This is not just any potato “meat” vegetable dish. All attention goes to baking the potatoes. We roast the vegetables in the oven so you don't have to worry about them. At the end you cook the vegetarian sausages in the pan with the potatoes.



The inspiration of this dish comes from tradition and family. Tradition, because who in the Netherlands or Belgium did not grow up with potatoes? Unfortunately they don't have the special kind of easy to fry tiny potatoes in London, where I currently live, so if I want baked potatoes I have to make something myself. And that's where family comes into the picture. My *papie* (grandfather) makes the best baked potatoes. Probably because of the amount of butter he uses. But also because of the spice mix afterwards.

Baked potatoes
--------------



##### 10 minutes preparation + 20 minutes cooking — serves 2



Ingredients
-----------



* 550 grams potatoes
* 500 grams broccoli
* 1 pack vegetarian sausages (you decide which one to choose. [Here](https://www.meerdanbroccoli.net/en/an-introduction-to-meat-replacements/) are some tips. We used [Richmond Meat Free Sausages](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/richmond-meat-free-saus-singleface-336g)).
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 0.5 tablespoon pepper
* Salt
* Oil or butter to bake the potatoes in the pan
* Paprika and onion seasoning
* Optional: mayonnaise



Preparation
-----------



1. Boil one and a half liters of water in a kettle.
2. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
3. Wash the potatoes and cut them into bite-sized pieces. *We keep the skin on the potato, but you can also peel them first.*
4. Boil the potatoes in a pot with the pre-boiled water and a pinch of salt for 5 minutes.
5. Wash and cut the broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Peel the stem and cut it into 1cm pieces as well.
6. Mix the broccoli with the olive oil and pepper in an oven dish.
7. Roast the broccoli in the preheated oven for c. 15 minutes. Keep separate.



Baking the potatoes
-------------------



8. Drain the potatoes.
9. Heat some oil or butter in a large pan.
10. Bake the potatoes for c. 10 minutes in the pan. Turn occasionally so that each side browns and becomes crispy. Use additional oil or butter if necessary.
11. Move the potatoes in the pan to one side. Add a little extra oil and add the vegetarian sausages to the pan.
12. Fry the sausages for c. 10 minutes in the pan. Turn them regularly so that they cook well. Turn the potatoes regularly as well.



Bringing it all together
------------------------



13. Serve the baked potatoes with the sausages and broccoli, and mayonnaise if using.
14. Season the potatoes with the satay herbs. *We do this afterwards on the plate so that you can choose how much extra herbs you want, but you can also add the herbs at the end while the potatoes are still in the pan to season everything evenly.*



##### Enjoy your meal!
