      - 'Serve the baked potatoes with the sausages and broccoli, and mayonnaise if using.'
      - 'Season the potatoes with the satay herbs. We do this afterwards on the plate so that you can choose how much extra herbs you want, but you can also add the herbs at the end while the potatoes are still in the pan to season everything evenly.'

The more time you spend on the baked potatoes, the better this dish gets. This is not just any potato “meat” vegetable dish. All attention goes to baking the potatoes. We roast the vegetables in the oven so you don't have to worry about them. At the end, you cook the vegetarian sausages in the pan with the potatoes.

The inspiration for this dish comes from tradition and family. Tradition, because who in the Netherlands or Belgium did not grow up with potatoes? Unfortunately, they don't have the special kind of easy to fry tiny potatoes in London, where I currently live, so if I want baked potatoes, I have to make something myself. And that's where family comes into the picture. My grandfather makes the best baked potatoes. Probably because of the amount of butter he uses. But also because of the spice mix afterwards.
