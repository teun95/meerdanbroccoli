This is a comfort dish for me. It reminds me of my childhood where my *moeke* (grandma) often made carrot mash for me, served with thin sausages. Of course I never get it as well prepared as she could make it.. but I do my best! This dish is as simple as it gets, making it perfect for a busy weekday. Or, if you love potatoes like me, this dish is just perfect any day of the week.
