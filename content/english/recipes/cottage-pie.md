Everyone loves a good pie filled with veggies and mince meat. This vegetarian version uses Vivera mince and can be filled with any vegetable you have leftover in your fridge. You can also use your leftover potatoes in any way you like - mashed or in slices. Feel free to make your own version but remember, the preparation of vegetarian mince is slightly different, you add it in later.

This quick version of a beloved pie, adapted from a basic recipe from the Dutch supermarket Jumbo, makes quick and easy use of a meat replacement, and a combination of vegetables that include peas which add additional protein to your meal. The more, the merrier!
