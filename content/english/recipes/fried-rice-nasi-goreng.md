excerpt: 'Nasi goreng, or fried rice, is a well-known dish in the Netherlands. But most of the time we see it as a side dish and not as a full meal. That is actually quite strange because in many countries in South East Asia, they often eat variations of fried rice as a main course. I decided to make a plant-based version of this beloved dish using tofu, a variety of vegetables and lots of flavor.'

A quick version of the Indonesian favorite. Nasi goreng, or fried rice, is well known in the Netherlands. But most of the time we see it as a side dish and not as a full meal. That is actually quite strange because in many countries in South East Asia they often eat variations of fried rice as a main course. I adapted this version from a recipe from the Dutch Boodschappen magazine. Instead of shrimp I used tofu, and because of the way of preparation you no longer need extra eggs. 
This nasi goreng is therefore slightly different from the versions you may be used to, but it is super tasty. With plenty of vegetables and a fresh taste of lime and ginger, this is a perfect weeknight meal. This is also a handy meal if you have some rice left over, just use the already cooked rice and skip steps 1 and 2.
Enjoy your meal!
